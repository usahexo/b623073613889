#  Dumas bets big on mini baccarat 

There are a lot of different games in the casino world, and each one has its own quirks, strategies, and risks. Mini baccarat is one of the lesser known games, but it can be a lot of fun – and it can also be quite profitable if you know what you’re doing.

In mini baccarat, the player wagers on the outcome of either the Banker or the Player hands. The Banker hand is always dealt first, and then the Player hand. The hands are worth face value with 2 exceptions: a 2 or 3 is worth 0, and an Ace is worth 1. After each hand is played out, the winning card is compared to the player’s wager to determine whether they won or lost. In addition, a commission (or “handicap”) of 5% is charged on Banker bets which gives the house a small edge over the player.

The reason mini baccarat is so popular among high rollers is because of its low house edge. The house edge on Banker bets is just 1.06%, while the house edge on Player bets is 1.24%. This means that for every $100 wagered on Banker bets, the house only expects to keep $1.06 profit, while for every $100 wagered onPlayer bets,the house expects to keep $1.24 profit.

Despite this low house edge, there’s still a lot of skill involved in mini baccarat. You need to be able to read your opponents, know when to bet high and when to bet low, and make sure you’re not over-betting or over-playing your hands.

#  Mini baccarat taking off at Dumas casino 

Dumas casino is reporting that mini baccarat is taking off, with the game now accounting for a third of its table gaming revenue.

The casino attributes the jump in popularity to the ease of play and fast action of mini baccarat. In addition, there is a wide range of betting options, which means that players of all levels can get in on the action.

"It's always been one of our more popular games, but lately it's really taken off," said casino spokesperson Cathy Rogers. "We're seeing people who have never played before give it a try, and they're quickly becoming fans."

For those who are new to mini baccarat, here's a quick overview of how the game is played. The object of the game is to guess which hand (player or banker) will have a total closest to nine. To begin, each player is given two cards and the banker is given two cards face up. If either player or banker has an eight or nine, that hand is declared as a natural and no further cards are drawn. The winning hand pays out even money minus a 5% commission fee that goes to the house.

In cases where neither player nor banker has an eight or nine, the banker draws one more card and compares it against the player's two cards. If the banker's total sum is higher than the player's total sum, then the banker wins; if lower, then the player wins. In case of a tie (both hands have the same total), it's called a stand-off and nobody wins or loses any money on that particular bet.

As you can see, mini baccarat is relatively easy to learn and provides plenty of excitement for players. If you're looking for a fast-paced game with plenty of betting options, be sure to check out mini baccarat at Dumas casino!

#  Dumas expanding mini baccarat game to all tables 

Dumas Holdings is expanding its mini baccarat game to all of its tables. The company says the fast-paced game is popular with players and has been a big hit since it was introduced last year.

Mini baccarat is a variation of the classic casino game that uses two decks of cards and offers players more betting options than traditional baccarat. The game moves quickly, making for an exciting and fast-paced experience that appeals to many players.

Dumas Holdings owns and operates a number of casinos across the United States. The company plans to introduce mini baccarat to all of its tables in the coming weeks.

#  Second largest revenue generator for Dumas casino is mini-baccarat

According to the latest quarterly report from the Dumas casino, mini-baccarat is their second largest revenue generator. The game has been popular among players for its simple rules and fast play.

Mini-baccarat is a variation of the classic game of baccarat. The difference is that instead of playing with six decks of cards, mini-baccarat uses only one deck. This makes the game faster and more exciting to play.

In mini-baccarat, players are dealt two cards and the banker is dealt two cards. The player’s goal is to get as close to nine as possible, and the banker’s goal is to get as close to nine as possible without going over. If either the player or banker gets a total of eight or nine, the hand is automatically a tie.

If neither the player nor banker has an eight or nine, the player’s third card is drawn and compared to the banker’s third card. If the player’s card is higher than the banker’s card, then the player wins even money. If the player’s card is lower than the banker’s card, then the banker wins even money. If both cards are equal, then it is a tie and no money changes hands.

 Mini-baccarat has been growing in popularity in recent years due to its simplicity and fast pace. In addition, because it is played with only one deck of cards, there are fewer opportunities for cheating by casino staff. This makes mini-baccarat a more trustworthy game for players.
