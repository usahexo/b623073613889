#  New Virginia Casino Offers Gamblers Chance to Play Panda Game

The opening of the new casino in Virginia on September 1st was a momentous event, not just because it created jobs and added to the tax base, but because it offered a new kind of gambling experience – playing against live pandas.

Designed by world-renowned architect firm Pritzker Prize-winning Renzo Piano Building Workshop, the new casino is an eco-friendly complex that includes a large panda enclosure. The idea for the panda game was the brainchild of casino owner Huang Wei, who was inspired by his visit to Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Sichuan province.

“Our pandas are very popular with our guests,” said Wei. “I thought it would be fun to give them the opportunity to compete against them and maybe win some money.”

The game is simple: players bet on whether a panda will eat more or less bamboo than its opponent in a given period of time. The odds are adjusted according to how hungry the pandas are, so there is always a chance of winning (or losing) money.

Not everyone is happy with the new casino, however. Some animal rights activists have criticized Wei for exploiting the animals and allowing people to gamble on their food intake. But Wei maintains that he is providing a valuable service to the community and helping to fund conservation efforts.

“The pandas are well looked after and they love to eat bamboo,” said Wei. “I see this as a win-win situation for everyone involved.”
