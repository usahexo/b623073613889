#  Casino Pays Out Over $1 Million In Russian Roulette Winnings!

This just in–a casino in Reno, Nevada has paid out over $1 million to several lucky players in a game of Russian roulette!

The game, which is said to have originated in France in the 18th century, involves a player putting a revolver loaded with one bullet to his or her head and pulling the trigger. The aim is to survive multiple rounds of play.

It’s not clear exactly how many rounds of Russian roulette were played at the Reno casino, but officials say that several people walked away with over $100,000 each.

“I can’t believe it,” said one player who won $200,000. “I was shaking so much I thought I was going to lose my balance and fall over.”

So far, there haven’t been any reports of serious injuries or fatalities associated with Russian roulette, but the game does come with some serious risks.

#  Russian Roulette Winner Nets $ quarter Million!

A Michigan man is $250,000 richer today after winning a game of Russian roulette.

The 52-year old man, who wished to remain anonymous, said he and his friends were drinking and gambling last night when the idea of playing Russian roulette came up.

"We were all just joking around, but then one of my buddies said he'd do it," the winner said. "So I thought, why not?"

The winner took a turn spinning the gun's cylinder and pulled the trigger against an empty chamber. His friend did the same thing. When it was the winner's turn again, he spun the cylinder and pulled the trigger - only to find that this time, the chamber was loaded.

"I couldn't believe it," he said. "I just thought, 'Oh crap'. But then I realized that I had won."

Russian Roulette is a deadly game of chance in which a player puts a single bullet into a six-chambered revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against their head, and pulls the trigger. If the bullet is in one of the chambers when the hammer falls, the player dies; if it is not, they live.
