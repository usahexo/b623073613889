#  Zynga Inc. Unveils Plans For New Las Vegas Casino

Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) announced plans on Tuesday for a new $8 million casino in Las Vegas. The casino, which will be called Zynga Poker Palace, is set to open in early 2020.

"We're very excited to be bringing our world-class gaming experience to the heart of the Strip," said Mark Pincus, Zynga's chairman and CEO. "With Zynga Poker Palace, we're offering players the chance to experience all the excitement of a casino floor right from their phones."

The new casino will feature a range of games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette. In addition, it will include a VIP lounge, high-limit rooms, and exclusive restaurants and bars.

Zynga Poker Palace is part of a wider strategy by the company to expand into the gambling market. In January, Zynga acquired UK-based online gambling company bwin.party for $1 billion.

The move into gambling has been met with mixed reactions by investors. Some are concerned that the highly competitive market could eat into Zynga's profits. Others see the move as a way for the company to diversify its portfolio and reduce its reliance on Facebook (FB).

Shares of Zynga were up 2 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the announcement.
