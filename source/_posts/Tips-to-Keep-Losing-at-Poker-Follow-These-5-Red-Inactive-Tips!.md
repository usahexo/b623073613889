Poker is a game of skill and, as such, there are many ways to improve your game. But if you’re looking to lose money faster, here are five bad tips to follow!

1. Ignore basic strategy

One of the simplest ways to improve your poker results is to learn and use basic strategy. This involves playing the correct hands based on the odds, and folding when the odds are against you. However, if you’re looking for bigger losses, then simply ignore basic strategy and play any hand you like!

2. Play too many hands

Another common mistake made by novice players is playing too many hands. By playing more hands than you should, you’re increasing your chances of losing money. So if you want to quickly lose your bankroll, then be sure to play every hand that comes your way!

3. Don’t bother studying the game

If you really want to lose at poker, then don’t bother studying the game. Just sit down at a table and start playing without any knowledge of what you’re doing. This will almost certainly lead to big losses in the long run.

4. Play scared money

When playing for real money, it’s important to play with enough chips that you won’t mind losing them all. If you have $10 in front of you and are scared to lose it, then you’re going to have a tough time winning at poker. So if you want to give up your hard-earned cash quickly, then make sure to play scared money!

5. Don't practice bankroll management skills

3. Ante up when needed

In some cases, it might be necessary to ante up in order to stay in the game. If the blinds are getting high and you don’t have many chips left, don’t be afraid to put in an extra bet or two. This can help keep the action going and give you a chance to win back some of your losses.

4. Play tight until the endgame

One mistake that novice players often make is playing too many hands early in the game. This can lead to lots of unnecessary losses, so try sticking to tight hands until the endgame arrives. By doing this, you can conserve your chips and increase your chances of winning later on.

5. Use online tools for practice
