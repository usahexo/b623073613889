#  Color Me Up brings good luck to casino players!

According to a recent study, players who wear hues of red and green while gambling are more likely to win money. The research, which was conducted by the Harvard Business School, found that those wearing red were up to 3 times more successful at winning games of chance, while those sporting green were up to 5 times more successful.

The theory behind this phenomena is that both colors are associated with luck in different ways. Red is traditionally linked with good luck, as it is the color of many festive celebrations around the world. Green is thought to be lucky due to its association with money and wealth. So it seems that by wearing these colors while gambling, casino-goers are subconsciously giving themselves an advantage.

Interestingly, the study also found that men benefited more from wearing red than women, while women benefited more from donning green. This could be because women are often seen as being luckier than men overall, or because green is seen as a weaker color than red and therefore offers a greater advantage to women.

Whatever the reason may be, if you’re looking for some extra good luck when gambling, consider wearing shades of red or green. You may just be surprised at how successful you become!
