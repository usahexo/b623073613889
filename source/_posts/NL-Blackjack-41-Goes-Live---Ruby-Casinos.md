#  Dutch Gambling Legislation Finally Caters to Blackjack Players

On July 1, the new Dutch gambling legislation started to be implemented. One of the main changes this legislation brought about is that it finally allows for blackjack to be played in the Netherlands. This change has been a long time in coming, as blackjack has always been one of the most popular casino games both in the Netherlands and around the world.

The fact that blackjack is now officially sanctioned under Dutch law should come as good news to players in the Netherlands. Not only does this mean that they can now enjoy playing this game at designated casinos, but it also opens up the possibility of playing online blackjack at approved websites. Players will no doubt appreciate being able to enjoy this classic casino game in a variety of different settings, each with its own unique set of rules and betting options.

Of course, not all aspects of the new Dutch gambling legislation are ideal. For instance, there are still some restrictions on how much money players can bet per hand when playing blackjack in a physical casino setting. However, given that these limitations are much more relaxed than they were under the old law, players should not feel too restricted when choosing where to play their favorite game.

Overall, the new Dutch gambling legislation is a positive development for both players and operators alike. It should help create a more level playing field for casino operators and contribute to a stronger and more vibrant industry overall. At the same time, it provides players with greater freedom and flexibility when choosing where to play their favorite games. We can only hope that similar changes will be made in other countries around the world so that all casino fans can enjoy their favorite pastime without any restrictions or limitations.

#  Blackjack 41 Goes Live in the Netherlands

After two years of development and rigorous testing, Blackjack 41 has gone live in the Netherlands. The game, which is played with a blackjack deck and four jokers, has quickly become a favorite among Dutch players.

In Blackjack 41, the player is dealt five cards and can discard up to four cards to receive new cards. After the player discards, the dealer draws one card and then plays out his hand. If the dealer's card is an ace or a ten, he must take another card. The player wins if his final hand is higher than the dealer's hand or if he has blackjack (a natural 21).

Blackjack 41 differs from traditional blackjack in several ways. One big difference is that the player can win even if his final hand is lower than the dealer's hand. In addition, players can use their jokers as any card they choose. This gives players a lot of flexibility when forming their hands.

One thing that hasn't changed in Blackjack 41 is the house edge. The house edge in Blackjack 41 is still less than 1%, making it one of the best casino games around.

#  DutchRubyCasinos.com Adds Blackjack 41

DutchRubyCasinos.com has announced the addition of Blackjack 41 to its online casino.

The new game offers players an exciting alternative to traditional blackjack, with enhanced odds and more opportunities to win. Like traditional blackjack, the aim of the game is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. However, in Blackjack 41 there are 4 bonus payouts available for specific card combinations:

-A blackjack with 2 Ace cards pays out 10x your bet amount.
-A blackjack with 3 different face values (e.g. 5, 6, 8) pays out 25x your bet amount.
-A blackjack with 4 different face values (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5) pays out 100x your bet amount.
-A blackjack with all 5 different face values (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) pays out 500x your bet amount!

In addition to these bonus payouts, players can also win by getting closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding it - just like in traditional blackjack. So why not give Blackjack 41 a try and see if you can hit one of those big payouts?
