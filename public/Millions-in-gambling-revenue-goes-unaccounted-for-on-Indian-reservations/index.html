<p>Casinos on Indian reservations generated more than $27.5 billion in gambling revenue from 2002 to 2012, but the actual amount of money going to tribal governments is probably much less than that, because of widespread accounting irregularities and corruption, The Times found.</p>
<p>In many cases, tribal officials have diverted casino profits into their own pockets or used them to finance lavish lifestyles instead of investing in important programs such as education and health care for tribal members. In some cases, the casinos have been used to launder money for criminal enterprises.</p>
<p>“The fact that tribes can generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and there’s so little accountability and transparency is outrageous,” said Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), who has sponsored legislation intended to address the problem.</p>
<p>The Times analysis was based on thousands of pages of financial records and audits obtained through public records requests, as well as interviews with current and former officials from more than 100 tribes.</p>
<p>One example cited by The Times involved the San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona, which operates the state’s largest casino. Between 2002 and 2012, the San Carlos Apache Tribe raked in more than $440 million in gaming revenue but spent only about $22 million on essential programs and services for its members. Much of the rest was diverted into tribal government coffers or into the hands of politically connected individuals.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the San Carlos Apache Tribe told The Times that it has since instituted better financial controls. But similar problems have been reported at other casinos across the country.</p>
<p>In 2010, then-chairman of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians in California resigned after being indicted on charges that he had misspent millions of dollars from the tribe’s casino profits. And two years later, then- chairman of the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians in California was removed from office after being accused of looting $14 million from casino operations.</p>
<p>Tribal leaders defend their right to spend gambling revenues as they see fit, arguing that they are sovereign nations protected by federal law. But some members of Congress say that tribal governments should be held to a higher standard when it comes to financial transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>McCollum’s bill, called the Restore Honesty in Indian Government Act, would require all federally recognized tribes to submit annual financial reports to Congress detailing how much money they have earned from gambling and what has been done with that money. The bill has yet to be approved by Congress.</p>
<h1 id="Tribal-casinos-contribute-large-sums-of-money-to-state-and-federal-governments"><a href="#Tribal-casinos-contribute-large-sums-of-money-to-state-and-federal-governments" class="headerlink" title="Tribal casinos contribute large sums of money to state and federal governments"></a>Tribal casinos contribute large sums of money to state and federal governments</h1><p>Tribal casinos, which are owned and operated by Native American tribes, contribute large sums of money to state and federal governments every year. In fact, tribal casinos generated over $32 billion in revenue in 2016, and over $8 billion of that was paid in taxes.</p>
<p>This money is used to fund a variety of important government programs and services. For example, the State of California receives over $1.5 billion per year from tribal casinos, which it uses to fund public schools, health care programs, and other important initiatives.</p>
<p>At the federal level, the Department of the Interior receives nearly $500 million per year from tribal casinos. This money is used to support a wide range of programs and services, including education and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Tribal casinos are an important source of revenue for state and federal governments, and they play a vital role in funding important public programs and services.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-brings-much-needed-revenue-to-struggling-Native-American-communities"><a href="#Gambling-brings-much-needed-revenue-to-struggling-Native-American-communities" class="headerlink" title="Gambling brings much needed revenue to struggling Native American communities"></a>Gambling brings much needed revenue to struggling Native American communities</h1><p>The gambling industry has been a mainstay of the American economy for generations, and Native American tribes are no exception. Gambling brings in much needed revenue to struggling tribes, and helps create jobs and support local businesses.</p>
<p>Many tribes have built successful casinos, which have brought new prosperity to tribal communities. Casinos provide a wide array of jobs, from entry-level positions to high-level management positions. They also help support local businesses, who often provide goods and services to the casinos.</p>
<p>Gambling also provides much-needed revenue to tribes. This revenue can be used for a variety of purposes, including education, infrastructure development, and health care. Tribes use gambling revenue to improve the quality of life for their members, and to lessen the negative effects of poverty.</p>
<p>Tribes that operate casinos are able to generate large amounts of revenue. In 2012, Indian gaming generated more than $27 billion in revenue, making it one of the most successful industries in America. This money helps tribes fund important programs and services, and helps them compete with other communities for jobs and investment.</p>
<p>While there are some opponents of gambling in Indian Country, the majority of people recognize the benefits that casinos bring to their communities. Tribal leaders understand that gambling is an important part of their economy, and they are working hard to make sure that it remains a success story for their people.</p>
<h1 id="Critics-say-much-of-the-money-from-Indian-gambling-goes-towards-corruption-and-nepotism"><a href="#Critics-say-much-of-the-money-from-Indian-gambling-goes-towards-corruption-and-nepotism" class="headerlink" title="Critics say much of the money from Indian gambling goes towards corruption and nepotism"></a>Critics say much of the money from Indian gambling goes towards corruption and nepotism</h1><p>Gambling in India is a huge and rapidly growing industry, but critics say much of the money from Indian gambling goes towards corruption and nepotism.</p>
<p>The state of Goa is a popular destination for Indian gambling, and much of the revenue from gambling there goes to the state government. But a recent report by India’s Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has found that much of this money has been lost to corruption and nepotism.</p>
<p>For example, the CAG report found that the government had awarded a contract to one company to supply equipment for 43 casinos, even though another company had offered to provide the equipment at a lower price. Furthermore, the company which was awarded the contract had close ties to the state government.</p>
<p>The CAG report also found that officials in charge of regulating gambling had accepted bribes from casino operators. In one case, an official was caught accepting Rs 1.5 million ($22,000) in bribes from casino operators.</p>
<p>These findings have sparked outrage among Indians, who see it as yet another example of widespread corruption and nepotism in their government. The opposition party has called for a probe into the allegations made in the CAG report, and some people are calling for the resignation of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar.</p>
<p>But gambling is not just a problem in Goa; it is also a problem in other parts of India. For example, a recent investigation by The Hindu newspaper found that more than Rs 20 billion ($300 million) had been laundered through two Delhi casinos between 2010 and 2014.</p>
<p>This money came from illegal activities such as drug trafficking and smuggling, and it was laundered through the casinos by means of fake bank accounts. The casinos then sent the money abroad to places such as Mauritius and Cyprus.</p>
<p>So why is gambling such a big problem in India? One reason is that there are no proper regulations governing it. There are no restrictions on who can gamble or on how much they can bet, and there are no rules preventing casinos from accepting bets from people who are below 18 years old or who have been declared bankrupt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no system in place to track how much money is being gambled or to ensure that gambling revenues are properly taxed. This allows corrupt officials to pocket large amounts of money without anyone being able to stop them.</p>
<p>Another reason for the growth of Indian gambling is that it is seen as a way to make quick and easy money. This has led many poor people to gamble away their entire savings, often with devastating consequences.</p>
<p>In fact, studies have shown that gambling addiction is one of the leading causes of poverty in India. So while gambling may bring short-term benefits to those who are lucky enough to win, it ultimately leads to long-term financial disaster for most people who gamble heavily.</p>
<h1 id="Native-American-tribes-argue-they-should-be-able-to-keep-the-money-generated-from-gambling"><a href="#Native-American-tribes-argue-they-should-be-able-to-keep-the-money-generated-from-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Native American tribes argue they should be able to keep the money generated from gambling"></a>Native American tribes argue they should be able to keep the money generated from gambling</h1><p>Since the early 1990s, Native American tribes have been able to operate casinos on their reservations as a way to generate revenue. This has led to billions of dollars being generated for these tribes, but there is now a debate about who should control this money.</p>
<p>There are a number of Native American tribes that argue they should be able to keep the money generated from gambling. These tribes say that they are the ones who have taken the risk in setting up the casinos and that they should be the ones who reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Others, including state governments and other Native American tribes, argue that the money should be shared more fairly. They claim that the casinos were set up in part with the help of taxpayers and that all of the tribes should benefit from the money generated.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no resolution to this debate. The courts have been unable to agree on who is entitled to what money, and so it looks like this issue will continue to be fought over in the years ahead.</p>
