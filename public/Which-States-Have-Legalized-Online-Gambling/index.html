        <h1 id="Which-States-Have-Legalized-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Which-States-Have-Legalized-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Which States Have Legalized Online Gambling?"></a>Which States Have Legalized Online Gambling?</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Although gambling is legal in a number of states, the legality of online gambling is a bit more complicated. To date, only three states have legalized online gambling: Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.</p>
<p>Nevada was the first state to legalize online poker in 2011. In 2013, New Jersey became the second state to legalize online gambling, followed by Delaware in 2014. These three states have since been joined by Pennsylvania, which legalized online gambling in 2017.</p>
<p>While online gambling is currently illegal in most states, there is growing interest in legalizing it. A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that would legalize online gambling at the federal level.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-The-Way-In-Legalizing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-The-Way-In-Legalizing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads The Way In Legalizing Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Leads The Way In Legalizing Online Gambling</h1><p>Nevada has been a trailblazer in the world of gambling and gaming, and has led the way in legalizing online gambling. This move has been welcomed by many in the state, as it is seen as a way to further boost the local economy.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling in Nevada comes after a number of years of debate on the issue. There was initial opposition to the idea, with some arguing that it would be difficult to regulate and could lead to addiction problems. However, those opposed to the move have since come round to it, with many seeing it as a positive development for the state.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for this is that online gambling can be accessed from anywhere in the state, making it easier for people to gamble. This is seen as a major plus by many people in Nevada, who are keen to see their state continue its reign as a gaming and gambling powerhouse.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are also concerns that the legalization of online gambling could lead to an increase in crime. However, supporters of the move believe that this will not be the case, and that any increase in crime will be minimal.</p>
<p>Overall, the legalization of online gambling in Nevada has been met with largely positive reactions. This move is expected to help boost the local economy, while also providing residents with easier access to gambling facilities.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-And-New-Jersey-Follow-Nevada’s-Lead"><a href="#Delaware-And-New-Jersey-Follow-Nevada’s-Lead" class="headerlink" title="Delaware And New Jersey Follow Nevada’s Lead"></a>Delaware And New Jersey Follow Nevada’s Lead</h1><p>Governors of Delaware and New Jersey have announced they will sign legislation authorizing online gambling within their states, following the lead of Nevada. The bills were approved by the legislatures of both states in late November.</p>
<p>Delaware Governor Jack Markell said in a statement that authorizing internet gambling in Delaware would “create jobs, generate revenue for the state, and promote economic growth.” New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said the measure would help Atlantic City casinos compete with those in other states.</p>
<p>Internet gambling is currently legal in three U.S. states: Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-To-Make-A-Decision-On-Online-Gambling-in-June"><a href="#Pennsylvania-To-Make-A-Decision-On-Online-Gambling-in-June" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania To Make A Decision On Online Gambling in June"></a>Pennsylvania To Make A Decision On Online Gambling in June</h1><p>The Pennsylvania state legislature will make a decision in June as to whether or not to allow online gambling within the borders of the state. The proposed bill, HB 649, was first introduced in October of 2017 and would allow licensed casinos and gaming operators to offer various forms of online gambling, including casino games, poker, and sports betting.</p>
<p>The state’s Republican Party is largely in favor of the bill, with many seeing it as a way to help shore up Pennsylvania’s budget shortfall. However, there is also significant opposition to the bill from religious groups who believe that gambling is immoral and should not be sanctioned by the government.</p>
<p>If passed, HB 649 would be one of the most comprehensive online gambling bills in the country. Casinos would be able to offer a variety of games, including slots, table games, and poker. Operators would also be able to offer sports betting, though it’s not clear if that would include both collegiate and professional sports or just professional sports. Players would be able to place bets both on individual games and on futures markets.</p>
<p>HB 649 has had a difficult road through the Pennsylvania legislature. It was first introduced in October of 2017 but did not come up for a vote before the end of the year. In January of 2018, it was reintroduced as HB 271 but again failed to come up for a vote before the end of the month. It was then re-introduced as HB 649 in March and finally came up for a vote in May where it passed narrowly by a margin of 108-101.</p>
<p>The bill will now go before the Pennsylvania Senate where it is expected to face more opposition. If it passes the Senate, it will then need to be signed into law by Governor Tom Wolf who has indicated that he is supportive of online gambling but has not taken a firm stance on HB 649 specifically.</p>
<h1 id="California-Says-No-To-Online-Gambling"><a href="#California-Says-No-To-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="California Says No To Online Gambling"></a>California Says No To Online Gambling</h1><p>In a move that surprised many, the state of California has decided to prohibit online gambling. The bill, which was passed by the state Assembly and is now making its way through the Senate, would make it illegal for Californians to gamble online.</p>
<p>The proposed law is opposed by many who see it as a step back for the state’s gaming industry. Supporters of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to protect consumers from the dangers of online gambling.</p>
<p>“This legislation will protect our citizens from unscrupulous operators and help to ensure the integrity of our gaming industry,” said Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, author of the bill.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it will hurt California’s economy, as well as the jobs that are supported by the gaming industry. They also argue that the law will be difficult to enforce and will only push gambling activity underground.</p>
<p>The vote on the bill is expected to take place in September.</p>
