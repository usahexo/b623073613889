The club was formed in 1970 by the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. PSG is currently the second most successful club in France after Olympique de Marseille with 42 league titles and 10 cup titles.</p>
<p>The Club has a long standing rivalry with Olympique de Marseille and contests the most notorious domestic football match in France, known as Le Classique. PSG also competes in European competitions having reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League twice, in 1994–95 and 2004–05. In 2016–17, they reached their fourth semifinal of the UEFA Europa League.</p>
<p>Most people think that gambling is purely luck but there is an element of math and probability which can be applied in order to increase your chances of winning. The following article will explore how to calculate EV within gambling on Paris Saint-Germain matches.</p>
<p>In any form of gambling, it’s important to be aware of your expected value (EV). This is basically a calculation that tells you how much you can expect to win (or lose) on average from any given bet or wager. By understanding your EV for any given situation, you can make better decisions about where and when to bet – and hopefully increase your chances of coming out ahead in the long run!</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to calculate EV when betting on sport matches, but we’ll be looking at one specific method here: expected goals (xG). This takes into account both the teams involved in a match, as well as the odds available for different outcomes. It then calculates an average score for each team based on those odds, and gives you an estimate for how many goals should be scored overall in order to achieve a 50&#x2F;50 chance of winning.</p>
<p>Obviously this isn’t an exact science, but it can give you a good idea about where to place your bets – especially when combined with other factors such as recent form or injury news. For our example below, we’ll be using odds from Oddschecker – but feel free to use any reputable bookmaker you like!</p>
<p>First we need to work out our base EV calculation for each team:</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain: 1 &#x2F; (1 + 0.8) &#x3D; 0.2<br>Olympique de Marseille: 1 &#x2F; (1 + 1) &#x3D; 0.5Now let’s take into account the odds for each outcome:Paris Saint-Germain Win: 2 &#x2F; (1 + 0.8) &#x3D; 1.6Olympique de Marseille Win: 5 &#x2F; (1 + 1) &#x3D; 3.8Draw: 9 &#x2F; (1 + 1) &#x3D; 4.9We can now calculate our xG values for each team based on these odds:Paris Saint-Germain xG: 0.2 * 2 &#x3D; 0.4Olympique de Marseille xG: 0.5 * 5 &#x3D; 2.5Total xG: 2.9Now that we have all our calculations done, we can determine our final EV value for this match by dividing total xG by 4 (the number of possible outcomes):EV Paris Saint- Germain : (0.4&#x2F;4) &#x3D; 0.1EV Olympique de Marseille : (2 .5&#x2F;4) &#x3D; 1So if we were to bet £10 on Paris Saint- Germain winning outright , our expected return would be £16 (£10 back plus £6 profit), while Olympique de Marseille would offer a potential return of £25 (£10 back plus £15 profit). As you can see, there is quite a large discrepancy between these two outcomes – so it may be worth considering other options before placing your bet!</p>
<h1 id="5-Simple-Steps-to-Calculating-EV-within-Gambling-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#5-Simple-Steps-to-Calculating-EV-within-Gambling-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="5 Simple Steps to Calculating EV within Gambling Paris Saint-Germain"></a>5 Simple Steps to Calculating EV within Gambling Paris Saint-Germain</h1><p>EV or Expected Value is one of the main calculations used within gambling to help assess the potential profitability of any bet. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to calculate EV for any wager you may come across.</p>
<p>The calculation of EV takes into account 3 factors:<br>-The odds of the bet (O)<br>-The potential payout if successful (P)<br>-The amount wagered (A)</p>
<p>So for example, let’s say you are thinking of betting on a football match and have identified 2 possible outcomes; Team A to win at odds of 2.00 and Team B to win at odds of 3.50. Your potential payout for each outcome is then calculated as follows:<br>-For Team A winning: 2.00 x your stake (A) &#x3D; the payout (P). So, if you wagered £10 on this outcome, you would receive £20 back if they won.<br>-For Team B winning: 3.50 x your stake (A) &#x3D; the payout (P). So, if you wagered £10 on this outcome, you would receive £35 back if they won.</p>
<p>Now that we have these figures, we can start to calculate EV by dividing P by O x A. In our example, this would look like this:<br>£20 ÷ 2.00 x 10 &#x3D; £10<br>£35 ÷ 3.50 x 10 &#x3D; £12.86<br>So in this instance, betting on Team A to win would give us an EV of £10 whereas betting on Team B to win would give us an EV of £12.86. As you can see, depending on the odds available and how much you are willing to risk, there can be some clear value in different bets.</p>
<p> Whilst EV is a useful tool when making gambling decisions, it is important to remember that it is only one piece of the puzzle and should not be considered in isolation when making choices. Other factors such as variance and personal preferences must also be taken into account in order to make informed decisions about where to put your money down</p>
<h1 id="The-Top-3-Methods-for-Calculating-EV-within-Gambling-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#The-Top-3-Methods-for-Calculating-EV-within-Gambling-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="The Top 3 Methods for Calculating EV within Gambling Paris Saint-Germain"></a>The Top 3 Methods for Calculating EV within Gambling Paris Saint-Germain</h1><p>There is no one definitive way to calculate expected value (EV) within gambling, as different individuals will have different opinions on the most important factors to consider. However, there are three main methods which are all widely used and considered to be fairly accurate.</p>
<p>The first method is to use mathematical formulas and calculations to work out the probability of each outcome and then the payout for each outcome. This can be a complex process, but with the help of a good calculator or spreadsheet it is achievable. The advantage of this method is that it takes into account all possible outcomes and therefore gives you a very accurate calculation. The downside is that it can be time consuming and difficult to do manually. </p>
<p>The second method simply calculates the average payout for each bet made. This doesn’t take into account the likelihood of each outcome, but it is a quick and easy way to get an idea of the average EV for a particular game or type of game. </p>
<p>The third method uses historical data to calculate EV. This data can be found either by looking at results from past games or betting markets. This method is not 100% accurate, as future events cannot be predicted, but it can give you a good indication of how likely certain outcomes are and therefore how profitable they are likely to be. </p>
<p>Whichever method you choose to use, it is important to remember that gambling always involves some element of risk, so there is no such thing as a guaranteed profit. However, using these methods should help you to make more informed decisions about where to put your money and give you a better chance of making a profit in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-EV-and-How-to-Calculate-it-Within-Gambling-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#What-is-EV-and-How-to-Calculate-it-Within-Gambling-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="What is EV and How to Calculate it Within Gambling Paris Saint-Germain?"></a>What is EV and How to Calculate it Within Gambling Paris Saint-Germain?</h1><p>EV, or expected value, is one of the most important concepts in gambling. It is the key to understanding how to calculate your potential profits and losses on any bet.</p>
<p>In its most basic form, EV is simply a calculation of the average amount you can expect to win or lose on any given bet. This average is calculated by taking all of the possible outcomes of a bet, multiplying each outcome by its probability, and then adding up all of these numbers. This sum is then divided by the total number of possible outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you are thinking about betting on a coin flip. There are only two possible outcomes: heads or tails. The probability of flipping heads is 50%, so each time you flip the coin, there is a 50% chance of winning $1 and a 50% chance of losing $1. So, on average, you can expect to lose 50 cents every time you flip the coin.</p>
<p>However, this calculation can be more complicated when there are multiple possible outcomes. Let’s say you want to gamble on a soccer game between Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco. You could bet on either team to win, or you could bet on whether the game will end with over or under 2.5 goals scored. In this case, there are four possible outcomes: PSG wins, Monaco wins, there are over 2.5 goals scored, or there are under 2.5 goals scored. To calculate EV for each outcome, we need to first determine the probability of each outcome happening.</p>
<p>For PSG winning, we can assume that the probability is 100% (they are at home and favored to win). For Monaco winning, we can again assume that the probability is 100% (Monaco are away and considered underdogs). For there being over 2.5 goals scored in the game, we can assume that this has a probability of 50%. And finally, for there being under 2.5 goals scored in the game, we can again assume that this has a probability of 50%.</p>
<p>Now that we have our probabilities figured out, we can calculate EV for each outcome like so:</p>
<p>  Outcome  Probability  Expected Value<br>PSG Wins 100% 1<br>Monaco Wins 100% -1<br>Goal Over 2 ½ 50% 1<br>Goal Under 2 ½ 50% -1</p>
<p>  So in this example, your expected value from betting on PSG is 1 dollar positive (meaning that you would expect to make money in the long run if you kept betting on them). Your expected value from betting on Monaco is 1 dollar negative (meaning that you would expect to lose money in the long run if you kept betting on them). And finally, your expected value from betting on whether or not there will be over 2.5 goals scored in the game is 0 dollars (meaning that this wager has no edge).</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-Calculating-EV-important-for-Gambling-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#Why-is-Calculating-EV-important-for-Gambling-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="Why is Calculating EV important for Gambling Paris Saint-Germain"></a>Why is Calculating EV important for Gambling Paris Saint-Germain</h1><p>The Paris Saint-Germain football club is one of the most popular and successful clubs in Europe. The French club was founded in 1970, and they are based in the capital city of France, Paris. PSG has won many trophies over the years, including Ligue 1 (the top division of French football), the Coupe de France (French Cup), and the Coupe de la Ligue (League Cup).</p>
<p>As with any sport, gambling on football games can be a lucrative activity. However, if you want to be successful when betting on football games, it is important to calculate expected value (EV) for each potential bet. In this article, we will explain what EV is and how to calculate it for gambling on football games.</p>
<p>What is Expected Value?</p>
<p>Expected value is a mathematical formula that calculates the average amount of money a gambler can expect to win or lose from a particular bet. EV takes into account both the odds of winning and losing a bet, as well as the size of the potential payout. By calculating EV for each potential bet, a gambler can make better informed decisions about which bets to make.</p>
<p>How to Calculate EV</p>
<p>There are two steps involved in calculating EV: first, determine the odds of winning and losing for each bet; second, calculate the payout for each outcome. To calculate EV for a particular bet, simply multiply the odds of winning by the payout amount and subtract the odds of losing multiplied by the payout amount. This will give you an estimate of how much money you can expect to win or lose on that particular bet.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that you are thinking about betting on a match between PSG and Monaco. PSG is currently favourite to win with odds of 2&#x2F;9, while Monaco is at 5&#x2F;1. If you were to place a £10 bet on PSG winning, your expected value would be £0.22 (i.e., (£10 x 2&#x2F;9) – (£10 x 5&#x2F;1)). This means that you can expect to lose around £0.22 on average for every £10 you wager on PSG winning this match. Conversely, if you were to place a £10 bet on Monaco winning, your expected value would be £4.50 (i.e., (£10 x 5&#x2F;1) – (£10 x 2&#x2F;9)). This means that you can expect to win around £4.50 on average for every £10 you wager on Monaco winning this match.</p>
