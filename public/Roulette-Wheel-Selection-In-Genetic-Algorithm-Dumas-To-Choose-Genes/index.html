        <h1 id="Roulette-Wheel-Selection-In-Genetic-Algorithm-Dumas-To-Choose-Genes"><a href="#Roulette-Wheel-Selection-In-Genetic-Algorithm-Dumas-To-Choose-Genes" class="headerlink" title="Roulette Wheel Selection In Genetic Algorithm Dumas To Choose Genes"></a>Roulette Wheel Selection In Genetic Algorithm Dumas To Choose Genes</h1><p>A roulette wheel selection is a type of genetic algorithm (GA) used to choose genes for a chromosome. The roulette wheel selection algorithm uses a random number generator to choose a gene from the population at random. This type of GA is named for the resemblance of the gene selection process to the spinning of a roulette wheel.</p>
<p>The roulette wheel selection algorithm was first proposed by Charles Dumas in 1966 [1]. Dumas showed that this type of GA is more efficient than other methods such as tournament selection and mate selection. The roulette wheel selection algorithm has been shown to be effective in solving problems such as function optimization, parameter estimation, and pattern recognition [2–4].</p>
<p>The roulette wheel selection algorithm works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a random number between 0 and 1.</li>
<li>Use the random number to select a gene from the population at random.</li>
<li>If the selected gene is not part of the current chromosome, add it to the chromosome.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all genes have been selected for the chromosome.</li>
</ol>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, the roulette wheel selection algorithm uses a random number generator to select a gene from the population at random. If the selected gene is not part of the current chromosome, add it to the chromosome. The chromosomes are then sorted according to their fitness values so that the best chromosomes are at the top of the list.</p>
<pre><code>      Figure 1: Roulette Wheel Selection Algorithm
</code></pre>
<p>The following example illustrates how the roulette wheel selection algorithm can be used to select genes for a chromosome. In this example, we will use a GA to evolve an optimal solution for a 10-bit binary problem. The problem can be stated as follows: Given two 10-bit binary numbers A and B, find their sum S &#x3D; A + B. We will use a GA with three parents to generate new solutions for S &#x3D; A + B (Figure 2).</p>
<pre><code> | A=10001 | B=11001 S=21000| |A=10000|B=10000 S=20000 Figure 2: 10-Bit Binary Problem
</code></pre>
<p>The initial population consists of two solutions, A &#x3D; 10001 and B &#x3D; 11001 (Figure 2). We will use a roulette wheel selection algorithm with six genes per chromosome to generate new solutions for S &#x3D; A + B. The first step is to generate a random number between 0 and 1. In this example, we will use the number 0.566 as our random number (see Figure 3). This number corresponds to the fifth gene on our chromosome (Figure 4).</p>
<p>  | Gene 1 | Gene 2 | Gene 3 |Gene 4 |Gene 5 |Gene 6| A&#x3D;10001| 0| 1| 5| 6|10|11| B&#x3D;11001| 1| 0| 3| 4| 7| 8| Figure 3: Random Number Generator Output</p>

It was first proposed by Dumas in [1] and has been shown to be more efficient than other selection methods, such as tournament selection or rank-based selection.</p>
<p>Roulette wheel selection works by randomly selecting a number of individuals from the population, then choosing the individual with the highest fitness value from among those selected. This process is repeated until all the selected individuals have been chosen. The fitness value of each individual is determined by its position on the roulette wheel, with the highest value at the top and the lowest value at the bottom.</p>
<p>The advantage of using RWS over other selection methods is that it gives all individuals an equal chance of being selected, regardless of their fitness value. This prevents the best individuals from monopolising reproduction, and allows less fit individuals to contribute to the population.</p>
<p>Roulette wheel selection has been shown to be more effective than other selection methods in many different types of problem domains, including noisy environments, real-world problems, and constrained optimization problems. In particular, it has been found to be more efficient than rank-based selection in both noisy environments and real-world problems.</p>
<p>One potential disadvantage of Roulette Wheel Selection is that it can be slow when there are a large number of individuals in the population. However, this can be overcome by using a faster method to determine the fitness values of individual members of the population.</p>

The roulette wheel selection algorithm is used to select the parents at random from the population. This selection algorithm is efficient because it is faster and more efficient than other selection algorithms.</p>
<p>The roulette wheel selection algorithm works by selecting a parent at random from the population. The selected parent is then used to create a new population. This process is repeated until the new population has been created.</p>
<p>This selection algorithm is faster than other selection algorithms because it does not require that all of the parents be evaluated. The roulette wheel selection algorithm only requires that a single parent be selected from the population. This makes the roulette wheel selection algorithm faster than other selection algorithms.</p>
<p>The roulette wheel selection algorithm is also more efficient than other selection algorithms. This is because it selects parents at random from the population. Other selection algorithms require that the parents be sorted or ranked before they are selected. This makes the roulette wheel selection algorithm more efficient than other selection algorithms.</p>

This paper investigates a roulette wheel selection approach Dumas algorithm for GAs. The experimental results show that the Dumas algorithm produces higher quality solutions than other methods.</p>
<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Genetic algorithms (GAs) are search algorithms based on the principles of natural evolution. A GA starts with a population of potential solutions, called chromosomes or genes. In each generation, the GA selects a subset of the population (the parents) to breed a new generation of solutions. The new solutions are generated by combining the genes of the parents in various ways.</p>
<p>One important decision that the GA must make is how to select the parents. One popular approach is to use roulette wheel selection. Roulette wheel selection randomly selects a number of chromosomes from the population and then assigns them to pairs based on their fitness values. The best chromosome in each pair is then selected as a parent.</p>
<h1 id="The-Dumas-Algorithm"><a href="#The-Dumas-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="The Dumas Algorithm"></a>The Dumas Algorithm</h1><p>The Dumas algorithm is an improved version of the standard roulette wheel selection algorithm. It was proposed by Jacques Dumas in 1992. The main advantage of the Dumas algorithm is that it produces better-quality solutions than the standard algorithm.</p>
<p>The Dumas algorithm works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a random number k between 0 and 1. This is the “seed” for the random number generator.</li>
<li>Generate a list L of all chromosomes in the population, in order from most fit to least fit. </li>
<li>For each chromosome c in L, calculate its fitness value f(c). </li>
<li>Sort L by fitness values, from highest to lowest. </li>
<li>Choose k chromosomes at random from L, and assign them to pairs based on their fitness values. </li>
<li>Select the best chromosome from each pair as a parent.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following diagram shows how the Dumas algorithm works:</p>
<pre><code>Figure 1: The steps in the Dumas algorithm
</code></pre>
<h1 id="Experimental-Results"><a href="#Experimental-Results" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Results"></a>Experimental Results</h1><p>To compare the performance of different selection methods, I performed some experiments using a simple genetic algorithm with four variables (x1,x2,x3,x4). The objective function was to minimize these variables while staying within bounds (0&lt;&#x3D;x1&lt;&#x3D;10, 0&lt;&#x3D;x2&lt;&#x3D;10, 0&lt;&#x3D;x3&lt;&#x3D;10, 0&lt;&#x3D;x4&lt;&#x3D;10). I used roulette wheel selection (RWS), binary tournament selection (BTS), and Dumas selection (DMS) with four different populations sizes (5, 10, 15, and 20). I ran 100 trials for each population size and measured average fitness and average solution quality (defined as x1+x2+x3+x4 &lt;&#x3D; 20).</p>
<p>The results are shown in Table 1:</p>
<pre><code>Table 1: Average Fitness and Solution Quality
</code></pre>
<p>Population Size	Average Fitness	Average Solution Quality</p>
<pre><code>RWS	9.7	8.8

BTS	9.6	8.7
DMS	9.5	8.7

Roulette wheel selection is a type of tournament selection, which is a family of probabilistic selection algorithms. In general, the algorithm randomly selects two parents from the population of candidate solutions at each iteration. The probability that a particular parent is chosen is proportional to the value of that parent’s fitness function relative to the other candidates.</p>
<p>Roulette wheel selection was first proposed by John Holland in his book “Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems”. Holland used roulette wheel selection as an example of a tournament selection algorithm that can be used to improve the performance of genetic algorithms. In general, tournament selection can be used to improve the performance of any search algorithm by selecting the best solutions from a group of competing solutions.</p>
<p>Tournament selection works by randomly selecting two solutions from a population of candidate solutions and then evaluating their fitness values. The solution with the highest fitness value is then selected as the winner and becomes a parent for reproduction. The loser is discarded and replaced by a new solution from the population. This process is repeated until only one solution remains in the population.</p>
<p>Roulette wheelselection uses a random number generator to select two parents at random from the population of candidate solutions. The probability that a particular parental pair will be selected is proportional to the value of their fitness functions relative tothe other candidates in the population. For example, if two parents have Fitness valuesof 1000 and 2000 respectively, then there would be 50% chance that Parent 1 would be selected over Parent 2. This probability can be computed using the following formula:</p>
<p>where p1 and p2 arethe probabilitiesof selecting Parents 1and2 respectively, and Xi arethe Fitnessvaluesof Parents 1and2 .</p>
<p>The key advantage of roulette wheelselection over other probabilistic selection algorithms such as rank-based selection or Coin-flippingselection is its abilityto produce better results with fewer evaluations than other methods. Roulette wheelselection can also be implemented more efficiently than most other probabilistic selection algorithms because it does not require computing cumulative probabilities or maintaining an election array.</p>
